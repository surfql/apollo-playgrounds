# SurfQL + Apollo Playgrounds
#### Get familiar with the visualization and autocomplete features offered by the SurfQL VS Code extension.

## Basic Setup
1. Clone the files to your machine in your preferred way ([Git tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
2. Open VS Code to the cloned project directory.
3. Navigate to `client/src/query.tsx` to view the GraphQL query within `query.tsx`.
4. In your VS Code's activity bar click on the SurfQL logo and then "View Schemas".
5. In the schema visualizer, turn on track mode.
6. As you modify the query, the visualizer should follow your updates.


## Server Setup
1. `CD` into the sever directory.
2. In the terminal run `npm install -g typescript` to globally install [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) if this hasn't been done before.
3. In the terminal run `npm i` to install the rest of the packages.
4. In the terminal run `npm start` to start the Apollo GraphQL server.

## Client Setup
1. `CD` into the client directory.
2. In the terminal run `npm install -g typescript` to globally install [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) if this hasn't been done before.
